# Basic: A boilerplate Ruby app

Welcome, Basic is simply a boilerplate Ruby app. It contains everything you need to get up and running with your own Ruby app.

RSpec and Cucumber are the testing frameworks of choice, and can all be run from Rake or from the commandline.

    bundle exec rake spec
    bundle exec rake cucumber
    
Enjoy...
